# SQL Business Insights – Online Retail Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end **SQL-based business analysis** using real-world online retail transaction data.

The objective is to demonstrate how **SQL alone** can be used to:
- Clean raw transactional data
- Explore patterns and trends
- Generate **actionable business insights** for decision-making

The analysis focuses on sales performance, customer behavior, and revenue trends using PostgreSQL.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning (SQL)
Data cleaning was performed directly using SQL:
- Removed transactions with zero or negative quantity
- Removed records with zero or negative unit price
- Removed rows with missing customer IDs
- Ensured appropriate data types for dates and numeric fields

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis
Key exploratory analysis includes:
- Total number of transactions
- Monthly revenue trends
- Country-wise revenue distribution
- Top-selling products
- Customer purchase frequency

---

## 📊 Business Insights Generated
- Monthly revenue trends to identify seasonality
- Top customers ranked by lifetime value
- Country-wise contribution to total revenue
- Average Order Value (AOV)
- Customer purchasing behavior patterns

These insights simulate real-world business questions answered using SQL.
